# Example LLM environment configuration for econ.simulator
# Copy this file to config/llm.env and fill in real values before starting the app.

# Provider selection (currently only 'openai' is supported)
ECON_SIM_LLM_PROVIDER=openai

# OpenAI API key (required for OpenAI provider)
# Replace the placeholder with your actual key, e.g.:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=

# Per-script LLM quotas (optional; defaults are used when left empty)
# Maximum number of LLM calls allowed per single script execution
ECON_SIM_LLM_MAX_CALLS_PER_SCRIPT=3

# Cumulative maximum tokens allowed per single script execution
ECON_SIM_LLM_MAX_TOKENS_PER_SCRIPT=1024

# Maximum tokens allowed for a single LLM call
ECON_SIM_LLM_MAX_TOKENS_PER_CALL=512

# Notes:
# - Keep this file out of source control if it contains real secrets. Use this
#   example file as a template and place the real values in an env file not
#   committed to the repository (or use system environment variables / secret manager).
# - The app will raise a runtime error if OPENAI_API_KEY is not set and the
#   configured provider is 'openai'.
